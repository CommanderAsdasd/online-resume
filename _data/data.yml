    I'm thinking that it's inmortant for an IT engineer to be not a “programmer on language X”, but an Engineer in general. My main skill isn't a certain technologies knowledge - technologies are countless and keep evolve - but ability to search, to understand, to figure out requirements, to architect solution with the best tools, and to learn from a mistakes, which always occurs.
    
    My main programming language is Python, because it’s like is an English in the world of computer languages, but I have been composing programs and writing computer poetry on counless languages, I have a special attitude towards Lisps.
    
    Also development process is not about tools, but it’s about people, so I understand importance of being team player and project management practices.
